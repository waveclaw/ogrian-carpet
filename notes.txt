Ogrian Carpet Notes


to add:
=========
amry counters
health/mana hud bars
meteor that claims nearby mana
players can rejoin and regain control of their team - and they automatically try to rejoin if they are dropped
move coastline to map file and dont let build castles right next to it
fix steep walls
move camerathing to game from renderer
summon monsters when summon ball touches things (instead of failing)
remove the bit about mana drifting downhill, and make them only update
periodically on think(), about every second or so - this might fix the
lag problems

make multiplayer start with monsters and mana, instead of just mana
make monsters drop all of their mana if they have no castle. towers too.
diagnostic key (f10) to calculate the total mana in the world


Sounds needed:
=========
claim ding (gratification sound)
tick jump attack
crane chirp attack
wizard death scream
teleport sound
claim whoosh
meteor whoosh
build whoosh
build construction sound




Ideas:
=========
Lighning spell: like a fireball, but jumps from enemy to enemy. Not sure what should cast lighting, maybe a miniboss?

for the tutorial, have TextBoxThing that pops up a textbox when teh camera touches it. Make many sublclasses or instances that link together, walking the player through the rules of the game. 


performance, tweaks:
========

known bugs:
========
memory leak in making billboards
