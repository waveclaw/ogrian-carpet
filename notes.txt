Ogrian Carpet Notes


to add:
=========
Hand Sprites - two frames, idle and casting, for each spell

Huts - claim them to increase your mana regen

Monsters
=========
-Crane - orbits castle towers for defense
-Albatross! - cruise missile
-Spider - follows the wizard around by jumping to a random spot near him, summoned with egg
-Sentinel - stationary gargoyle that shoots fireballs and sends up flares when enemies nearby
-Imp - mobile archers that follow the wizard around

-firestorm - very rapid fire with randomish trajectories (done)

need new art for:
=========

Ideas:
=========
have think() have setThinkPeriod() per thing.
for the tutorial, have TextBoxThing that pops up a textbox when teh camera touches it. Make many sublclasses or instances that link together, walking the player through the rules of the game. 


performance, tweaks:
========

known bugs:
========
camera doesn't interact with castles in the same way that it does with the ground
two baloons get sent to one mana
memory leak in making billboards
