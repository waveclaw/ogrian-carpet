Ogrian Carpet Notes

spell selection system:
the Spell object will encapsulate the spellThing and the hud graphics.
the hud will have a series of spell slots, each of which holds a Spell object.


to add:
=========
Hand Sprites - two frames, idle and casting, for each spell

towers - summoned, tall to stand on and claim nearby mana
Huts - claim them to increase your mana regen

Monsters
=========
-Crane - orbits castle towers for defense
-Albatross! - cruise missile
-Spider - follows the wizard around by jumping to a random spot near him, summoned with egg
-spikeflower - shoots spikes, summoned with seed
-Imp - island natives that guard huts and have some kind of group ritual spell.

Spells 
=========
-fireball (done)
-claim (mana, hut)
-build (castle, tower, also unbuilds)
-firestorm - very rapid fire with random trajectories
-inferno - several fireballs held in place relative to the camera
-firewave - pattern of fireballs the travel along the ground
-summon monster
-unsummon (monster, mana, hut, etc)
-jump
-speed
-meteor


need new art for:
=========
claim spell - from particle demo
spider - make new model from pipe cleaners?
spikeflower - make model from real flower
imp - hand drawn with pencil
hand sprites - photos of my hands
tower/hut textures - ask banana?


Ideas:
=========
have think() have setThinkPeriod() per thing.
for the tutorial, have TextBoxThing that pops up a textbox when teh camera touches it. Make many sublclasses or instances that link together, walking the player through the rules of the game. 


performance, tweaks:
========
do something about coastal fireball accumulation
