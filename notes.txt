Ogrian Carpet Notes

to add:
=============
Hand Sprites

Castle
Huts
Baloons

Monsters
-Crane
-Spider
-Fireblossom (new sprites with real flower)
-Imp (new sprites: hand drawn)

Spells 
-firestorm - very rapid fire with random trajectories
-inferno - several fireballs held in place relative to the camera

Ideas:
=========
for the tutorial, have TextBoxThing that pops up a textbox when teh camera touches it. Make many sublclasses that link together, walking the player through the rules of the game.
