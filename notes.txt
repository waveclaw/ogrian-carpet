-Albatross - cruise missile
-Spider - follows the wizard around by jumping to a random spot near him, summoned with egg

tower/hut textures - ask banana?


Ideas:
=========
for the tutorial, have TextBoxThing that pops up a textbox when teh camera touches it. Make many sublclasses or instances that link together, walking the player through the rules of the game.
