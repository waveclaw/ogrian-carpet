Ogrian Carpet Notes

to add:
=========
Hand Sprites - two frames, idle and casting, for each spell

towers - summoned, tall to stand on and claim nearby mana
Huts - claim them to increase your mana regen

Monsters
=========
-Crane - orbits castle towers for defense
-Spider - follows the wizard around by jumping to a random spot near him, summoned with egg
-spikeflower - shoots spikes, summoned with seed
-Imp - island natives that guard huts and have some kind of group ritual spell.

Spells 
=========
-fireball (done)
-claim (make castle, claim mana, claim hut)
-firestorm - very rapid fire with random trajectories
-inferno - several fireballs held in place relative to the camera
-firewave - pattern of fireballs the travel along the ground
-summon spider
-summon spikeflower
-summon tower
-unsummon (spider, flower, tower, mana, hut)


need new art for:
=========
claim spell - from particle demo
spider - make new model from pipe cleaners?
spikeflower - make model from real flower
imp - hand drawn with pencil
hand sprites - photos of my hands
tower/hut textures - ask banana?


Ideas:
=========
sprite LOD system - have a billboardset for each colour, when a sprite is far from the camera, remove the sprite from the renderer and add another dot to the same-coloured billboardset in it's place. the coloured billboard sets should use flat shaded, round-cornered squares for the material and should be before sprites in the renderqueue. Since there should only be about half a dozen colours in use at a time, this should be feasible, and greatly improve performance.

four players max, each starts at one corner of the island.

for the tutorial, have TextBoxThing that pops up a textbox when teh camera touches it. Make many sublclasses or instances that link together, walking the player through the rules of the game. 


performance, tweaks:
========
Sprite LOD
remove heightmap averageing
ground scan on/off flag
make physics grid finer, shrink foliage, and extend teh grid to surrounding 50% or so of ocean
can only summon castles on land, outside minimum distance from other buildings
