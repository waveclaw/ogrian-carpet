Ogrian Carpet Notes


to add:
=========
amry counters
health/mana hud bars
meteor that claims nearby mana
players can rejoin and regain control of their team - and they automatically try to rejoin if they are dropped
move coastline to map file and dont let build castles right next to it
fix steep walls


Sounds needed:
=========
claim ding (gratification sound)
tick jump attack
crane chirp attack
wizard death scream
teleport sound
claim whoosh
meteor whoosh
build whoosh
build construction sound




Ideas:
=========
for the tutorial, have TextBoxThing that pops up a textbox when teh camera touches it. Make many sublclasses or instances that link together, walking the player through the rules of the game. 


performance, tweaks:
========

known bugs:
========
